In this tutorial we’re going to create a very simple JSON schema and generate it with Plank. This short exercise will give you the foundation to write complex schemas for your app.

### Creating a Schema

Schemas are a JSON document. We’ll start with a schema that is simple adaptation of the one declared at the beginning of this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gCJ-lTiwmOiTjMmVxJIMzMCAimFEiUQORKserTI68c/edit#heading=h.3qktp9j6yx33)

Start by creating a file named `example_model.json`.

```
{
    "id": "schemas/example_model.json",
    "title": "example_model",
    "description" : "Schema definition of my example model",
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": { "id" : { "type": "string" },},
    "required": [] 
}
```

### Generate the Model

To generate the models, run this command:

`plank schemas/example_model.json` 

The generator will not only generate this class but it will generate its superclass (if defined) and any other class that is referenced by a [JSON Pointer](/plank/2017/02/13/json-schema.html). The classes will be available for you in the current working directory.

### Property Types

- Explore different property types (integer, number, boolean, URI strings, Datetime strings, arrays, objects)

### References

- Create another schema (another_example_schema.json) and reference it in your original schema with a JSON Pointer

### Collections

- Add collection properties such as objects and arrays and specify their item types. For extra credit, specify the item type as a JSON Pointer (self-referential pointers work as well!).
