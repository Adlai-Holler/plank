# Schema Editor and Code Generation Guide 
## What is JSON-Schema?

JSON Schema is a powerful tool for validating the structure of JSON data. In practice, these schemas can be used to create validators, code generators and other useful tools to handle complex and/or tedious issues. There is a great online overview of JSON-Schema and its specifics here: [http://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/#](http://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/#). For the purposes of this document we will only be concerned with version 4 of JSON-Schema.

## JSON Schema Basics

Here is a simple schema and overview of the fields listed.

    {
        "id": "schemas/user.json",
        "title": "user",
        "description" : "Schema definition of a User",
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "id" : { "type": "string" },},
        "required": [] 
    }
| id (string)                      | The id property identifies where this resource can be found. This can either be a relative or absolute path. In addition, schemas that are accessed remotely can be accessed by specifying the correct URI. This value will become more important when we discuss JSON Pointers below. |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| title (string)                   | Title is used to identify the name of the object. The convention we use is all lowercase with underscores (“_”) to separate words (i.e. “offer_summary”).                                                                                                                              |
| description (string)             | Description is a helpful place to specify more detail about the current model object or property.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| $schema (string, URI formatted)  | This is a URI to the json-schema version this document is based on. This will be the default schema URI for now: "[http://json-schema.org/schema#](http://json-schema.org/schema#)"                                                                                                    |
| type (string)                    | Specifies the type, currently this is always “object” when declared outside of the properties map. Valid types are “string”, “boolean”, “null”, “number”, “integer”, “array”, “object”.                                                                                                |
| properties (map<string, object>) | Properties are where most of your editing will be focused. This area allows us to specify the property names (as the key) as well as their expected type.                                                                                                                              |
| required                         | List of property names that are required to be present in the JSON response. This is currently unused but eventually could be utilized to provide tighter validation of schema responses.                                                                                              |


**Property fields** 
Properties are where most of your editing will be focused. This area allows us to specify the fields that are available on this model. The properties declaration is a map from the property name to a simple schema that describes the property. 

The keys follow the same naming conventions as title field (lowercase, underscore separated) and should map directly to the key that will be used in the JSON response. The value will be an object that can be one of the types specified earlier or a reference to another JSON-schema file (via JSON Pointer `$ref` ). 

In addition, there is syntax for providing concrete subtypes such as dates, URIs, and emails as shown below. A full list can be seen under the JSON-Schema type-specific documentation [here](http://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html).
Type-specific examples

**JSON Pointers**

****Most of these property declarations should be straightforward to understand with the exception of JSON Pointer. This is a specific syntax that is used to reference the location of other JSON files. 
The key for a JSON pointer is “$ref” and the value is a path relative to the base location which was specified by the “id” key.

Here’s an example of how the pointers destination is resolved.

1. The schema declares an **id** property:
2. "id": "[http://foo.bar/schemas/address.json](http://foo.bar/schemas/address.json)"
3. There is a property defined with a JSON pointer as its value.
4. “some_property_name” : { "$ref": "person.json" }
5. When the pointers destination is resolved, it will be:
6. http://foo.bar/schemas/person.json


# Generating Code with Plank
## What is Plank?

[Plank](https://phabricator.pinadmin.com/diffusion/PMD/) (working title) is a command-line code generation tool. The goal of this project is to generate model classes for Objective-C (iOS) initially and then expand to Java (Android) in the future. The model schema definitions are represented in the json-schema v4 format.
**Goals of the model classes**

- **Immutability** : Model classes will be generated with Immutability as a requirement. Each class will have "Builder" classes that will aid in mutation.
- **Type** **Safety** : Based on the type information specified in the schema definition, each class will provide type validation and null reference checks to ensure model integrity.
- **Custom Validation** : Each property can specify a set of parameters that will be used for validation. Examples of these properties are defined in the json-schema v4 specification.
## Creating a new Schema

**Tutorial**
In this tutorial we’re going to create a very simple schema that should provide enough guidance to write complex schemas. Some of the contents will be related to the iOS project but the actual schemas are platform independent.

**Creating a new schema file**
Create a new file there called “example_model.json”

**Start writing your schema.**

Schemas are a JSON document. We’ll start with a schema that is simple adaptation of the one declared at the beginning of this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gCJ-lTiwmOiTjMmVxJIMzMCAimFEiUQORKserTI68c/edit#heading=h.3qktp9j6yx33)


    {
        "id": "schemas/example_model.json",
        "title": "example_model",
        "description" : "Schema definition of my example model",
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "id" : { "type": "string" },},
        "required": [] 
    }


**Generate your model classes**
`plank [path to schema]` 
To generate the models, run this command:
`plank schemas/example_model.json` 
The generator will not only generate this class but it will generate its superclass (if defined) and any other class that is referenced by a [JSON Pointer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gCJ-lTiwmOiTjMmVxJIMzMCAimFEiUQORKserTI68c/edit#heading=h.ykiwozj6u36d). The classes will be available for you in the current working directory.

Exercises for the reader

- Explore different property types (integer, number, boolean, URI strings, Datetime strings, arrays, objects)
- Create another schema (another_example_schema.json) and reference it in your original schema with a JSON Pointer
- Add collection properties such as objects and arrays and specify their item types. For extra credit, specify the item type as a JSON Pointer (self-referential pointers work as well!).
## Future work
- Support for the definitions key in JSON-Schema. Definitions is a lighter form of declaring small schemas and can also be referenced with a JSON Pointer.
- Documentation Generation.
- Proper error reporting and logging for invalid schemas.
- Generate from API responses rather than local handwritten schemas.
- Make models available as a separate Cocoapod to automate generation and integration.

**Model Class Overview**
JSON Schema to Objective-C type mapping

| String Property                     | NSString                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Boolean Property                    | BOOL                                                           |
| Integer Property                    | NSInteger                                                      |
| Date-time Property (String variant) | NSDate                                                         |
| Email Property (String variant)     | NSString (there isn’t a more suitable class at this time)      |
| URI Property (String variant)       | NSURL                                                          |
| JSON Pointer Property ($ref)        | ModelType                                                      |
| Array Property                      | NSArray                                                        |
| Array Property with Item types      | NSArray<ModelType *> where model type could be any other type. |
| Object Property                     | NSDictionary                                                   |
| Object Property with item types     | NSDictionary<NSString *, ModelType *>                          |


**Supported Protocols**
The protocols currently supported are [NSCopying](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCopying_Protocol/index.html) and [NSSecureCoding](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSSecureCoding_Protocol_Ref/index.html). NSCopying allows us to support copy operations which for immutable models will simply return **self**. NSSecureCoding allows the models to be serialized by NSCoder which can be a useful solution for data persistence. 

## Generated Methods

******Model Class**
These methods can be found in any base model class. The first four are various ways to initialize an instance of a model and the last is the api that will be used for mutation.

    + (nullable instancetype)modelObjectWithDictionary:(NSDictionary *)dictionary;
    - (nullable instancetype)initWithDictionary:(NSDictionary *)modelDictionary NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER;
    - (nullable instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER;
    - (nullable instancetype)initWithBuilder:(BuilderObjectType)builder NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER;
    - (instancetype)copyWithBlock:(void (^)(BuilderObjectType builder))block;

**Builder Class**

For each model there is also a builder class that is generated. The builder is a common [pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) that we are using to create mutations of existing models. It achieves this by managing the copying of existing values and allowing the caller to specify mutations without altering the original model. The builder has a readwrite property for every property declared on the model class it creates. It can also be used to generate a model instance by itself as well.

The first method is related to initialization and accepts an instance of the model class that is builds. The build method will take the current value of the properties defined on the builder and create a new model immutable instance.

    - (nullable instancetype)initWithModel:(ObjectType)modelObject;
    - (ObjectType)build;
## Objective-C specific generation notes

**Lightweight Generics**
The generated models/builders utilize the [lightweight generics](http://www.miqu.me/blog/2015/06/09/adopting-objectivec-generics) feature that was introduced as part of the updates to Objective-C in XCode 7. They allow the models to specify the exact types they create while keeping their interfaces generic. The declaration of lightweight generics should be done for you by the generator.

**NSValueTransformer Support**
The use of custom transformer types is currently not available and not planned for the generator. The only exception to this rule is when handling date-time property types. Because date formats can vary, the project owner is responsible for providing a NSValueTransformer subclass that will parse the date format supplied by their API. This value transformer should be registered with 
NSValueTransformer with the key “kPlankDateValueTransformerKey”.


    [NSValueTransformer setValueTransformer:[PINDateValueTransformer new]            
                                    forName:kPlankDateValueTransformerKey];

**Immutability & Mutation**
The models are currently all immutable. Immutability allows us to have many benefits with regards to safe concurrency and correctness. Often there will be a small mutation necessary (incrementing the like count, etc.) that will have to be made and the generated builder classes will help you achieve that. 
There are two primary ways to mutate a model.

1. Use the `copyWithBlock` method available on the model class (modern, preferred approach)

    // Create a model object
    PIPin *pin = [PIPin modelObjectWIthDictionary:someDictionary];
    PIPin *newPin = [pin copyWithBlock:^(PIPinBuilder *builder) {
                    builder.descriptionText = @”Some new description text”;
    }];

2. Use the builder object directly. (classic builder pattern style)

    // Create a model object
    PIPin *pin = [PIPin modelObjectWIthDictionary:someDictionary];
    PIPinBuilder *builder = [[PIPinBuilder alloc] initWithModel:pin];
    builder.descriptionText = @”Some new description text”;
    PIPin *newPin = [builder build];
# Migrating Models

When a new PIModel is created, we need to remove all instances of the corresponding CBLModel in the codebase. Here’s how to migrate everything over. PIPin+PIAdditions and PIPinAPIController should have examples on the following areas.

Generated properties (i.e. pin.richSummaryString) should go in the +PIAdditions category of the model.

## Collections on a model

Collections on a model (i.e. board.pins) should go in the + PIAdditions category of the model.

## Networking logic

Networking logic should go in a PIAPIController subclass (i.e. PIPinAPIController). Make sure to post a model update notification if the model is mutated by the network call

## KVO

PI* models will not respond correctly to KVO and we should remove the KVO calls. Register for model update notifications using the NSNotification+PIAdditions category methods instead.

## General Process

It can be helpful to do a Find/Replace to convert all references to the CBL* class name to the PI* one, and then migrate out needed functionality based on the errors that come up. If there are too many errors, you may also choose to pull out the CBL logic into the category and controller methods first.
